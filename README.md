I recently completed an introductory MS Excel course on Great Learning, enhancing my understanding of spreadsheets and data management. Today, I uploaded my course completion certificate to GitHub, showcasing my newfound skills. Throughout the course, I learned how to organize data, create basic charts, and use formulas effectively. This experience has sparked my interest in technology and data analysis, inspiring me to explore more about how Excel can be used in different subjects like math and science. Special thanks to Great Learning for making learning fun and interactive. I'm excited to continue exploring and learning more about Excel and its applications!
